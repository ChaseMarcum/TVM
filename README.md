Business Economics Calculator Website
===

John Price and Chase Marcum decided to design, develop, and deploy a Business Economic Calculator website in lieu of writing a final paper to expand and practice our software / web development skills.

We implemented 29 business economic formulas that utilized our design of two variable equations and three variable equations using a generic controller and view and would display and calculate the correct formula based on the model selected.

We utilized JavaScript to preform our calculations and in our design for the Time Value Money formulas we inserted the logic to perform the correct calculation based on the missing variable on the form.
 
•	29 Business Economic formulas descriptions and calculator.
•	Time Value Money calculator that can calculate Future Value, Present Value, Rate, Number of Periods, or Payment.
•	Simple Balance Sheet form.
•	Simple Income Statement form.
•	Expanding Sidebar Menu.

Utilized: ASP.NET MVC, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, JQuery UI, Bootstrap, and Visual Studio 2013.
